# SRC Directory
Directory that contains all of the nodes that make up the scene trees in Godot.


## Sub Folders:
### [Actors](./actors)
Reusable nodes and scenes, here divided to enemies/player scenes of our levels.
### [Levels](./levels)
Reusable nodes and scenes, here divided as the levels in the game.
### [Objects](./objects)
Objects are nodes that interact with the player on levels, that we organize here because they do not have an intelligence.
