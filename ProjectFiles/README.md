# Project Files Directory
Main Project Directory. for use in Godot 3.23+.

## Use
Organizes trees of nodes into reusable scenes, wiring said nodes with signals that interact with GDScript. 

## Information
This is meant to be a dummy template repository for basic learning and git version control.
I will comment frequently as I work on this and other similar projects.

### Assets Directory
[Directory of media.](assets)
### SRC Directory
[Directories of nodes.](src)

### Icon
[![logo](icon.png)](./icon.png) **icon.png**

One can change **icon.png** to be the logo for any project. It will display here, in Godot, and in the root [README](../README.md) file.

### Addons
The addons directory is ignored by root `.gitignore`.
Include needed addons either in the main Project Files Directory, or in a subfolder other than addons.
This is mainly a personal preference by me to avoid uploading unecessary copies of [Wakatime For Godot](https://github.com/thomazthz/godot-wakatime),
A useful tool but extraneous and unecessary to share(especially when considering security).

### Post Scriptum
