# Project Files Directory
Main Project Directory. for use in Godot 3.23+.

## Use:
This directory rganizes the file structure that runs Godot. 

Godot is a game engine that organizes trees of nodes into reusable scenes, wiring said nodes with signals that interact with GDScript. 

## Information:
_This is meant to be a dummy template repository for basic learning and git version control.
I will comment frequently as I work on this and other similar projects._

### - [Assets](./assets) Directory
Directory of media.

### - [SRC](./src) Directory
Directories of nodes.

### - [Icon](./icon.png)
[![logo](icon.png)](./icon.png) **icon.png**

One can change **icon.png** to be the logo for any project. It will display here, in Godot, and in the root [README](../README.md) file.

### - project.GODOT file
What Godot will have to open to make sens of these files.

### - LICENSE file
Godot's Copyright and MIT License information

### - Addons
The addons directory is ignored by root `.gitignore`.
Include needed addons either in the main Project Files Directory, or in a subfolder other than addons.
This is mainly a personal preference by me to avoid uploading unecessary copies of [Wakatime For Godot](https://github.com/thomazthz/godot-wakatime),
A useful tool but extraneous and unecessary to share(especially when considering security).

### - Post Scriptum
If you're reading this,

ðŸ‘‹Thank You for taking a peek! More to come.
